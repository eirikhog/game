# Untitled Game

This is a personal hobby project, writing a game from scratch.
The goal is to not use any libraries (except for OpenGL and native platform APIs etc).

The purpose of this project is purely educational.

## Implementation

The programming language is C++ (very limited subset).
Rendering is done with OpenGL, and will be limited to 2d drawing.

Currently the supported platform is Windows.

## Remaining work

- Asset system
 - Generation of asset file from images, fonts, etc.
 - Using the generated file in the game.
 - Support images
 - Support fonts
 - Support sounds
- Renderer
 - Better handling of scaling/resizing
 - Shader quality
 - Ligning
- World generation
 - Procedural level generation
- Game input
 - Gamepad support
 - Mouse and keyboard support
- Other
 - Remove external library usages
 - Gameplay!
