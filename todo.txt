Ideas/todo list for the game.

Game memory:
 - Remove use of malloc/free
 - Implement an allocator which can use the memory we reserve at startup.
   We don't want to depend on allocating memory while we're running.

Asset system:
 - Can we keep everything in memory on startup?
   (For now: Yes!)

Rendering:
 - Lighting effects
 - Particle effects

World generation:
 - Everything...

Game input:
 - XInput: Load dynamically (library might not be installed/available?)

Diagnostics:
 - Display render time, etc in the game window.

Standard library:
 - Get rid of the usage. Don't want to depend on it.
